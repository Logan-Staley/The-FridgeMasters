Security Policy
1. Access Control:

    Restricted Access: Only team members and collaborators with a legitimate need should have access to the repository.
    Role-Based Access: Assign roles (e.g., admin, write, read) based on responsibilities. Not everyone needs admin rights.
    Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Require all collaborators to enable 2FA for their GitHub accounts.

2. Code Reviews:

    Mandatory Reviews: All pull requests (PRs) should be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.
    Protected Branches: Protect main and production branches to prevent direct pushes. Changes should only be merged through PRs.
    Automated Testing: Integrate continuous integration (CI) tools to run tests automatically for every PR.

3. Dependency Management:

    Regular Updates: Regularly update all dependencies to their latest versions to avoid known vulnerabilities.
    Automated Scanning: Use tools like Dependabot to automatically scan for and address vulnerabilities in dependencies.

4. Code Secrets:

    No Hardcoded Secrets: Avoid hardcoding secrets (API keys, database passwords) in the code. Use environment variables or secret management tools.
    Scan for Exposed Secrets: Use tools like git-secrets or GitHub's secret scanning to detect accidentally committed secrets.

5. Issue Reporting:

    Private Reporting: If someone discovers a security vulnerability, they should have a way to report it privately (e.g., a dedicated email).
    Template: Provide an issue template for reporting security vulnerabilities, guiding the reporter to provide necessary details.

6. Continuous Monitoring:

    Activity Monitoring: Regularly review the repository's activity logs to detect any suspicious behavior.
    Integrate Security Tools: Use GitHub Actions or other CI tools to integrate security scanning tools that check the codebase for common vulnerabilities.

7. Training & Awareness:

    Regular Training: Ensure that all collaborators are aware of best practices in secure coding and are updated about any new threats.
    Stay Updated: Follow industry news and GitHub's updates to stay informed about any new vulnerabilities or best practices.

8. Incident Response:

    Plan: Have a clear incident response plan in case of any security breaches or vulnerabilities.
    Communication: Ensure clear communication channels among team members to address any security incidents promptly.
